Hello! 
The purpose of this folder is these are the small projects that I've learned and developed when I was learning how to code with several programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. and it really helped me understand the fundamentals of developing software and websites that will help me be able to learn and build advanced projects in the future.
